Some standardChop-related issues still on my mind           LNT 21 Dec. 2015




1. IMPERFECTIONS IN STANDARDCHOP BEHAVIOUR?


1.1.  exp(3i*x) gives a bad plotcoeffs picture


1.2.  Figs 5 vs 6 in examples/approx/Noisy are surprising



2. THINGS WE MIGHT DO QUICKLY


2.1.  Should Chebfun simplify after addition?
 

2.2.  Should chebfun eps be renamed chebeps?  The current name is confusing.


2.3.  The EXPLAIN code.  Better name?  Avoiding saving data?




3. OTHER MATTERS


3.1.  Can we work in a fixed length?  (Cf. ode-nonlin/Logistic2)


3.2.  One day we should make solution of ODE IVPs scale-invariant.


3.3.  What theorems can we prove concerning behaviour of standardChop?


3.4.  Why do we get so many exactly zero coeffs?  From DCT doubling?
      See e.g. the example of 1.1 above.
